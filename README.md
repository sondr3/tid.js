# Tid

`tid.js` is a tiny and stupidly simple library to display how long ago something
was posted online. It's inspired by likes of [`timeago.js`](timeago) and
[`jquery-timeago`](jquery-timeago), but has no options for configuring it nor
for locale.

## Usage

Download the `index.min.js` script and add it to your webpage and make sure your
`time` elements contains a `datetime` attribute that is parseable by
